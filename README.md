#This is the a react project.
#The only way to edit it is by using react javascript.
#We have used react-bootstrap tools, and we have installed the plugin(dependencies for react-bootstrap).
#So to use bootstrap tools you can just import them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-So in this commit we have created the login and register pages, which are not fully functional.
-We have added new files for register inside a folder called "Components".
-Please do not add files to this folder directly, instead create a new folder inside it that will hold your files.
-For landing page files please create a new folder inside "Components" folder and put your files in there. 
-For login php files please create a folder called authenticate inside "Components" folder then put your php files in there.
-For the landing page php files please also create a folder inside "Components" folder and put those php files in there.

#important note!!!
#this is to make the code as clean as possible and easy to work on.
